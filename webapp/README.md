# Guidelines

The UI follows the [Material Design guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). The following items are specific call outs:

* Use sentence case in labels, buttons, and other UI elements
* Avoid "please" and other filler words.
* Write for a global user base
* Avoid abbreviations.
* Use second person "You ...".
